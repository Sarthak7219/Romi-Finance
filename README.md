# Romi-Finance
Internshala assignment to clone site zomifinance 

OUR TASK:
1. Cloning: We'd like you to create an exact clone of https://zomi.finance/
2. Branding Update: Integrate the "Romi.Finance" logo provided to you, ensuring it replaces the existing logo. Additionally, wherever the name "Zomi Finance" appears, replace it with "Romi.Finance".
3. User Experience: Ensure a front-end experience that's both intuitive and functional.

MAIN FOCUS:
Specifically, the "Home", "Dashboard", and "Earn" sections. The other sections can be disregarded.
Ensure your HTML is clean, and all required assets, JS, and CSS are structured well.
